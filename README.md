# Python Learning Journey

This repository contains my notes, practice files, and small programs as I learn Python.  
The purpose is to stay consistent and keep my progress organized in one place.

I am keeping all older code as it is.  
The goal is to show how my Python skills improve over time, not to make everything perfect.
